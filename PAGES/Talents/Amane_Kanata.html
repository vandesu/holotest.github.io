	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Kanata is an angelic denizen currently studying at the Heaven Academy to become a full-fledged angel. She is currently 18 years old. (She specifies that this is her "angel age", but has stated in past streams that this is the same as her human age.)</p>

	<p>Kanata is extremely sweet, polite, friendly and demure. She is somewhat more quiet and reserved when compared to her contemporaries in hololive's fourth generation, and her sense of humor generally tends to be less crass or vulgar.</p>

	<p>However, she admits she has a playfully "sadistic" streak to her, which usually manifests in her teasing her audience or playing pranks on her fellow hololive members. She has also admitted that she is markedly shy and that she sometimes tries to conceal this with a "cool facade" when around other people. Kanata has also been noted by viewers as genuinely somewhat innocent and even a little naive, leading to viewers becoming (jokingly) concerned that she may be "corrupted" by other hololive members such as Kiryu Coco or Natsuiro Matsuri.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Appearance</h2>
	<p>She typically wears her Heaven Academy school uniform along with a small, shiny, metallic halo over her head that resembles the shape of a star. This same four-pointed star-shape is also seen on her uniform's buttons. The high collar of her school uniform frequently conceals part of her face. Her uniform's ribbon is consistently uneven/lopsided. Gaps in her bangs reveal that she has cobalt-blue highlights. Kanata also has two feathered wings which can be seen over her shoulders, as is typical of angels (in several episodes of AsaCoco Live News Kiryu Coco has found innovative uses for the feathers they produce).</p>
