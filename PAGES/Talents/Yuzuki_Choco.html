	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>With a way of speaking that blurs the line between maternity and seduction, Choco is as sweet as her name suggests. Because she blurs the line between erotic and motherliness so much to the verge of pointless nitpicking and is so unapologetically feminine as a result, she has caused various confusion and mixed responses as to how others see her. For example, Aragami Oga has described her as unironically family friendly while YouTube has gone on the record to de-monnitize her for being "too sexy". Even the animators behind Holo Grafiti seem to take advantage of this facet, as she would be rocking Rushia to get her to calm down one episode but show herself to be provocative in the next.</p>

	<p>As a former school nurse, she is cautious about her audience's wellbeing and health. She is most well known for her ASMR streams that do as they should and sooth and put to sleep, though some do feel heat from the erotic undertones. True to her old life as a teacher, she is very knowledgeable and will sometimes take up the role of a teacher to pop quiz other holoIdols as challenges. Though being a demon, sometimes her sense of humor can be rather morbid, such as the time in her birthday stream in which she promised to take Oozora Subaru to a fun haunted house of horrors before becoming the horror herself by trying to cook the ducky idol alive, toying with her life.</p>

	<p>She greets her viewers with "Good evening, my cute students. Cho-kon!~♪"</p>
