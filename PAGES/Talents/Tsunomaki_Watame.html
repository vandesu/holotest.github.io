	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Watame speaks in a pleasant tone befitting her image of a soft fluffy sheep. Her voice has been noted by fans to be especially soft, mature and womanly. However, in direct contrast to this image, Watame often amuses herself by making crazed facial expressions. Her wide-eyed, psychotic smile has become iconic on her channel, even appearing on some of her official merchandise (a double-sided pillow cover). She also bobs and weaves her head and body around, which has become one of her signature gestures that she does especially when singing.</p>

	<p>She seems to be okay with her fellow hololive members eating her during collaboration streams, as she reassured her fans that even if she was eaten she would respawn after an 8-second timer.</p>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Fans</h2>
	<p>Her fanbase is officially called "Squad Rose" in English while it is called "Rose-tai" 「ロゼ隊」 in Japanese.</p>

	<p>"Anpontan Sisters", along with Roboco and Himemori Luna.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
	<p>Aki is unique among the Japanese branch of hololive as being the only polynymous member whose full name is not formatted in the typical Japanese style (i.e. Last Name followed by First Name) but instead the typical Western style. Likewise her last name "Rosenthal" is also unique within hololive due to being the only last name of Western origin (specifically German).</p>
	<p>As demonstrated in several episodes of holo no graffiti, Aki's floating twintails are detachable, capable of being "worn" by other hololive members, and are apparently even sentient and capable of talking, moving and flying on their own.</p>
	<p>Aki is specified to be a half elf from another world, though the details of what exactly that means are currently unclear.</p>
	<p>In one of the most bizarre elements of hololive lore, Aki is apparently capable of spontaneously producing a wide variety of different objects and materials from between her thighs. In an episode of holo no graffiti Aki involuntarily produced a vast amount of poisonous liquid from between her thighs causing the flooding of the entire office. In another episode Aki was able to will herself into "giving birth" to Oozora Subaru from between her thighs after Subaru had been magically eliminated from the universe. The exact nature of this strange ability and why Aki has it are unclear. Other hololive members have alluded to the fact that it is somehow related to Aki's identity as "a half elf from another world", but they have never specified as to what this means and why Aki has this ability.</p>
	<p>She is the fourth member of hololive after Artia, Kiryu Coco, and Amane Kanata to join the official hololive Subreddit as a moderator.</p>
	<p>Aki can play guitar, piano, drums, and other instrument. She can do belly dancing very well and even taught other members on stream, like Coco, Marine, Fubuki and Watame.</p>
	<p>On Coco's Reddit Meme Review, Aki said that she is not a fan of the TakaMori ship, stating that she prefers MoriTaka.</p>
	<p>While TakaMori indicates that Kiara is the top and Calliope is the bottom, MoriTaka has it vise versa, in which Calliope is the top and Kiara is the bottom.</p>
	<p>Aki's name personally given by Motoaki Tanigo, Cover Corp. CEO.</p>
	<p>Since August 2020 Aki accompanied by Ashino do acoustic karaoke streams every last week of a month.</p>
	<p>Her avatar in ARK: Survival Evolved is an extremely muscular, bearded male nicknamed "MukiRose".</p>
	<p>Aki inherited her Siren mother's habit of stripping down naked for seemingly no reason.</p>
	<p>Her favourite fetish is tentacles.</p>
