<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Okayu is typically very relaxed, free-spirited, and also somewhat of a playboy or prankster. She sometimes flirts openly with other hololive members just to see their reactions and is also known for impulsively swiping food. She never denies her wrongdoings and was handed a guilty verdict in several "Okayu Court" cases, after which she obediently served her sentence. Okayu typically likes to talk a lot and through many streams likes to talk about daily activities and old stories.</p>

	<p>Despite her laid-back personality, Okayu can get very emotional when playing games to the point that she can break down into tears during emotional moments in the story. This happened most notably when she finished: The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, where she cried on stream after beating the game for a few minutes and needed a moment to compose herself.</p>

	<p>She greets her viewers with "Mogu! Mogu!", the Japanese sound of chewing.</p>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Fans</h2>
	<p>Her fanbase is officially called "Onigiryaa" (おにぎりゃー).</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
<p>Whenever she puts all focus on gameplay, she often makes unintelligible battle cries such as "nya," "rua," and "wryy."</p>
<p>She spent half a month grinding PvP in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate after it was released on 7 December 2018, hoping to get to VIP ranking. She mainly played as Cloud, Joker, and Lucina.</p>
Her favorite animes are Yosuga no Sora and Lovelive!, but she doesn't know the song 届かない恋 from White Album.
The nickname "Sololive" comes from the fact that she tends to play games alone.</p>
<p>She is a fan of the comic artist Tsukudani Norio as well as Inuyama Tamaki, who was designed (and voiced) by her.
She likes reading light novels, but can barely read them because of most of the texts being not annotated with furigana, and instead spends most of her time reading manga (with annotated furigana).</p>
<p>She uses a lot of exclamation marks in her tweets (！！！). This behavior has spread to other virtual YouTubers.</p>
<p>Aqua is known for faking retirements on multiple occasions, singing sad songs and ending her streams with a black screen. During a Minecraft stream on 2 February 2019, she performed another retirement speech during a stream on hololive's Minecraft server, on which she created a model of herself and blew it up with TNTs, which were supposed to be the fireworks celebrating her retirement.</p>
<p>Aqua has been noted by other members of hololive as being particularly slight, short, and petite in terms of stature. During Aqua's Wii Fit stream, in addition to revealing her height to be 4 feet and 10 inches (148 cm), she accidentally revealed her weight to be a mere 95 pounds (43 kg). When Aqua first met Murasaki Shion in-person, Shion (who is already comparatively short) apparently remarked at how "small" Aqua was and condescendingly patted her on the head, much to Aqua's dismay. Aqua's short and light build is something other hololive members frequently lightly tease her over but simultaneously something they cite as a part of what makes her cute. Aqua's height of 4' 10" is coincidentally the typical length of a mop-handle, which has resulted in an ongoing meme in which fan-art depicts her as a mop among her fans, sometimes as a red onion and a tissue box on top of the handle.</p>
<p>She is really close to Kagura Mea, having done a lot of collaborations with Aqua, with their pairing being known as "Meaqua" (稱めあくあ). She has also gone to Mea's house on multiple occasions to do streams, with her going as far as to call her girlfriend on a tweet from 8 March 2019.</p>
<p>She made a group called the hololive Resistance army Iron Aqua Group. She is the leader and creator of the group in Minecraft, with a large underground base full of TNT. According to her, she is ready to rebel at any moment. She showed the place to Matsuri, and Matsuri became a member of hololive Resistence too. Unfortunately for her, Matsuri betrayed her during Tokino Sora's visit. Aqua's morale remained high while Aqua facing Sora until she called her an enemy, which caused her to stop speaking properly.</p>
<p>Her "group" was latter referenced when she appeared on Dawn of the Breakers, on which her unit name is called hololive Resistance.</p>
<p>She likes to say "You are weak; I am strong" (お前、弱い、あてぃし、強い) whenever she faces a boss when playing games like Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. She often gets fixed up even before she can finish the whole sentence.</p>
<p>Aqua established her own company, Akukin Kensetsu, on the hololive Minecraft JP server and recruited Houshou Marine as her first employee (eventually 2nd-in-command), before expanding to recruit Ookami Mio (3rd-in-command) to compete with Usada Kensetsu. Akukin Kensetsu later conducted a series of interviews to recruit more employees. From it, 8 employees were added: Yuzuki Choco, Yukihana Lamy, Momosuzu Nene, Aki Rosenthal, Amane Kanata, Airani Iofifteen, Shiranui Flare and Yozora Mel. The company now counts 11 employees.</p>
<p>In 2021, Aqua was chosen, along with Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII from as a character to be crafted into a bust and placed at the examination site of Kyoto University and have various offerings placed in front of her, as per school tradition. The offerings Aqua received included 1,000 Yen, a bottled water, rice balls and a discounted purple onion.</p>
