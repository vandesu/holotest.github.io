	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Suisei is a modest, multitalented singer and aspiring idol who is among the more level-headed members of hololive, though she also has a childish streak. After her unexpectedly compelling performance as a traitor in a game of Project Winter, she gained a reputation for remorseless sociopathy behind a facade of polite sweetness. No one seems to know how much of the "Psychopath Suisei" persona is real or not, but Suisei herself acknowledges that it is extremely funny and has referred to the incident on multiple occasions.</p>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">History</h2>
	<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Her Twitter account and YouTube channel were created on 18 March 2018. Her introduction video was uploaded four days later on 22 March.</p>

In Suisei's case, her stream was scheduled for March.</p>

	<p><a href="../Songs/Tokino_Sora_Songs.html">See here.</a></p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Events</h2>
	<p>She debuted as a DJ at Re:Animation 13 on 12 January 2019.</p>
	<p>On 4 April 2019, she made an appearance in hololive's collaboration with Dawn of the Breakers, she was the central character, and the first ever hololive VTuber to appear in the game. Despite appearing alongside Shirakami Fubuki, Oozora Subaru, Minato Aqua and Yuzuki Choco the first two events were called "The Roboco san x Dawn of the Breakers Crossover".</p>
	<p>On 28 January 2020, it was announced on Dengekionline that she would make an appearance in the game Neptunia Virtual Stars as one of the VTuber guest characters alongside Tokino Sora, Shirakami Fubuki, Sakura Miko, Minato Aqua, Yuzuki Choco, Inugami Korone, Shirogane Noel and Houshou Marine.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Fans</h2>
	<p>Her fanbase is officially called "Stargazers", while in Japanese they are called "Hoshiyomi" 「星詠み」.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
	<p>Considerably multi-talented as she is capable of drawing (her original image was drawn by herself), edit videos, sing, cook and is also a skilled gamer.</p>
	<p>Suisei lives with her older sister, who is referred to by fans as "Anemachi". Anemachi is extremely attached to Suisei and appears to be dependent on her for her cooking skills.</p>
	<p>She is notably good at playing competitive Tetris.</p>
	<p>The hashtag #星街すいせい3D (#HoshimachiSuisei3D) became a trending topic worldwide on Twitter when she debuted her 3D model on YouTube.</p>
	<p>Her birthday and her debut date are the same.</p>
	<p>A few years before considering being a VTuber, Suisei participated in several auditions for real-life idol agencies, but was rejected due to the "Jack of all trades, Master of none" trait, according to her. This led to her becoming a Virtual Idol, as a way of not giving up on her dream. However, she was already tired of trying by the beginning of 2019 as an indie Virtual Idol (since she worked in an izakaya [japanese pub], and also had to do the editing of her own videos and other VTubers). Suisei almost gave up, but decided to make one last try. She went to COVER Corp to audition for hololive, but was also rejected, apparently for the same reason as the real-life agencies, since COVER Corp considered that she had many skills (speaking, singing, dancing, drawing and gaming) that could let to failing trying to do everything due to an overload of work. She claims that after receiving rejection e-mail, she e-mailed back seeking for a second chance and is open for suggestion. As a result, hololive replied back to have a second talk; then they told her that she could join, but on the condition of joining INoNaKa Music and focus on music. After more difficulty in INoNaKa Music mostly due to company policy that nearly broke Suisei's heart, she was finally transferred to hololive officially. </p>
	<p>On 11 January 2021, Suisei won the 2nd hololive Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Tournament, with 43 points.</p>
	<p>Suisei's surname, while officially written in English as "Hoshimachi", is often alternatively romanized as "Hoshimati" or "Hosimati" in her videos and account names.</p>
	<p>Suisei popularized the phrase "Hi, honey!" during a Duolingo English learning stream. Although Akai Haato was technically the first to use it, Suisei's endearing delivery of the line, coupled with her recent voice change, has since caused many other members of hololive to repeat it in a similar fashion.</p>
