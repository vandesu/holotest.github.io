	<p class="additional-desc">【初配信】ホロライブ5期生の雪花ラミィです！【 ほろふぁいぶ】<br>Lamy's introduction.</p>

</div>
<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Her personality can be described as "pure and all-loving". Lamy is soft-spoken, kind, and gentle, but somewhat shy and easily flustered. Both her friends and fans refer to her as "Lamy-mama" due to her motherly aura.</p>

	<p>She is close with the rest of the fifth generation of hololive, Shishiro Botan especially. The two are known for their playthroughs of horror games, with some commenting on Botan acting like a protective husband for the terrified Lamy (despite the former clearly enjoying Lamy's reactions).</p>

	<p>While Lamy was originally touted as one of the more "seiso" members of hololive (similar to the traditional idol-like Tokino Sora), this has since come into question by both the fanbase and other holomembers due to occasional moments of lewdness, some yandere tendencies, and (most of all) her fondness for alcohol.</p>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Fans</h2>
	<p>Her fanbase is called 「ふぁんでっど」(Fandeddo), which is an attempt to combine the words「Fan（ファン）」with the word「Undead（アンデッド）」. In English, her fanbase is officially called "Fandead".</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Relationships</h2>
	<h3>Units and groups she is part of:</h3> 
	<p>"Anpontan Sisters", along with Roboco and Himemori Luna.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
	<p>Aki is unique among the Japanese branch of hololive as being the only polynymous member whose full name is not formatted in the typical Japanese style (i.e. Last Name followed by First Name) but instead the typical Western style. Likewise her last name "Rosenthal" is also unique within hololive due to being the only last name of Western origin (specifically German).</p>
	<p>As demonstrated in several episodes of holo no graffiti, Aki's floating twintails are detachable, capable of being "worn" by other hololive members, and are apparently even sentient and capable of talking, moving and flying on their own.</p>
	<p>Aki is specified to be a half elf from another world, though the details of what exactly that means are currently unclear.</p>
	<p>In one of the most bizarre elements of hololive lore, Aki is apparently capable of spontaneously producing a wide variety of different objects and materials from between her thighs. In an episode of holo no graffiti Aki involuntarily produced a vast amount of poisonous liquid from between her thighs causing the flooding of the entire office. In another episode Aki was able to will herself into "giving birth" to Oozora Subaru from between her thighs after Subaru had been magically eliminated from the universe. The exact nature of this strange ability and why Aki has it are unclear. Other hololive members have alluded to the fact that it is somehow related to Aki's identity as "a half elf from another world", but they have never specified as to what this means and why Aki has this ability.</p>
	<p>She is the fourth member of hololive after Artia, Kiryu Coco, and Amane Kanata to join the official hololive Subreddit as a moderator.</p>
	<p>Aki can play guitar, piano, drums, and other instrument. She can do belly dancing very well and even taught other members on stream, like Coco, Marine, Fubuki and Watame.</p>
	<p>On Coco's Reddit Meme Review, Aki said that she is not a fan of the TakaMori ship, stating that she prefers MoriTaka.</p>
	<p>While TakaMori indicates that Kiara is the top and Calliope is the bottom, MoriTaka has it vise versa, in which Calliope is the top and Kiara is the bottom.</p>
	<p>Aki's name personally given by Motoaki Tanigo, Cover Corp. CEO.</p>
	<p>Since August 2020 Aki accompanied by Ashino do acoustic karaoke streams every last week of a month.</p>
	<p>Her avatar in ARK: Survival Evolved is an extremely muscular, bearded male nicknamed "MukiRose".</p>
	<p>Aki inherited her Siren mother's habit of stripping down naked for seemingly no reason.</p>
	<p>Her favourite fetish is tentacles.</p>
