	<p>Loves jewels, treasure, and money. Her dream is to become a pirate and go treasure hunting. In order to get a pirate ship, she is now stacking up money as a VTuber on the great lands, just like how the other land-lovers do (which also means she is currently just a girl cosplayer).</p>

	<p>She acts like a big sis and sometimes seduces people like a succubus does.</p>

	<p class="additional-desc">【 宝鐘マリン初配信】はじめまして、マリン船長です。【ホロライブ 新人Vtuber】<br>Marine's introduction.</p>

</div>
<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Marine is a bold, fast-talking girl who often throws caution to the wind, making obscene jokes and playfully mocking both her higher-ups and her viewers. Marine describes her way of approaching people is through to talk to them so she may get in their circle, as described when talking about the differences between herself and Nakiri Ayame.</p>

<p>She often struggles to keep her lewdness in check, with her openly lusting after fictional female characters, reading BL and claiming to be a former shotacon (despite still showing some attraction in fiction). This has lead her to describe herself as extremely horny, with the phrase "I'm Hornyyyy!~♪" being a fan favorite since her 3D stream with Kiryu Coco. At times she even tries charming and seducing her way out of sticky situations, which has backfired on her at times.</p>

<p>Though she claims to be 17 years old, her self-described "auntie" voice, lack of physical stamina, and extensive knowledge of 2000-2010 Internet culture indicate that she is almost certainly older than she claims she is. This is supported by other hololive members' habits of teasing her about her age. Her age has become a recurring joke on her channel; for example, on 30 July 2020 (Marine's birthday), she claimed to be turning 17 again for a "second season", to which Himemori Luna states, via a drawing, that she is 27.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of the antics Marine is popular for, Marine typically shows herself to be cultured with the variety topics she brings up in her streams, ranging from popular to niche, and regularly talks about the happenings behind the scenes at hololive on her own accord. She is also extremely sensitive to her surroundings especially when it comes to social environment, as she was able to instinctively pick up Usada Pekora's discomfort with others in her space and even spoke up about how she managed to avoid trouble in a previous office job such as avoiding getting yelled at by her ex-boss. As such she is marked as having "the highest stats" in social insight out of every idol in hololive by her fans.</p>

<p>She greets her viewers with "Ahoy!", a typical pirate greeting.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Appearance</h2>
	<p>Marine cosplays as a pirate. She has crimson red hair, tied into twintails with laced ribbons, topped with a removable pirate hat. She has heterochromia, with her left iris being golden, and her right iris is red.</p>

	<p>On 18 October 2020, Marine debuted with a new outfit. Her twintails remain, but extended and loosely curled, spiraling neatly towards the end at her ankles. Instead of her pirate hat, she now adorns a tophat.</p>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Fans</h2>
	<p>Her fanbase is officially called "Suba-tomo"「スバ友」.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
	<p>The character designer for her original design is Tanaka Yuuichi, who is known as the character designer for A Certain Magical Index and My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO!, among others. Her hairstyle bears some similarity to the main characters of both shows, Misaka Mikoto and Hikigaya Hachiman respectively.</p>
	<p>During a collaboration stream with Suou Patra of HoneyStrap, Miko confirms that her "NyaHello" greeting is a reference to Yuigahama Yui from Oregairu, who is also designed by Tanaka Yuuichi. In the series, Yui greets characters with "Yahallo".</p>
	<p>Miko also sang a cover of the song Yukitoki, which was the opening song in the first season of the anime.</p>
	<p>She has varying official height measurements.</p>
	<p>On 5 March 2019, she agreed with an artist that deduced her height to be about 156 to 157 cm.</p>
	<p>On 28 March 2019, she tweeted an image stating her height to be at 153 cm.</p>
	<p>During the Arte Akihabara and hololive collaboration campaign, an official height chart of hololive virtual YouTubers was put on display with her height being stated as 152 cm. Her official website also lists her as this height.</p>
	<p>She started to work as a VTuber to fulfill her dreams of becoming an idol.</p>
	<p>She likes playing Eroge and has a playlist of her Eroge streams in her channel.</p>
	<p>She has, in many occasions, accidentally opened an Eroge in the middle of playing another game in her stream.</p>
	<p>She once told during one of her streams that Saga Planets is her favorite Eroge Studio. Among the games from this studio she has played and streamed are Hatsuyuki Sakura, Kin'iro Loveriche, and Natsuyume Nagisa.</p>
	<p>She collaborated on a stream with Maimoto Keisuke of Nijisanji about Eroge Opening music.</p>
	<p>One of her most "eroge lover" moments, was during a Minecraft stream (privated, with avaiable translate), when she asked to be insulted, to try to annoy her. The first two people didn't do anything to her, but just a few seconds later, one guy said "Eroges are boring", and she went totally annoyed.</p>
	<p>Miko is well known for her frequent interactions and friendship with Usada Pekora on and off screens, forming the pair “PekoMiko”. As the pair is famous hololive released the song “PekoMiko Daisensō” as one of the song for collaboration with the rhythm game WACCA themed after the duo’s interactions and their unofficial collabs that are known as “wars”.
	<p>Miko has proclaimed to be Tokino Sora biggest fan, she was already a fan before joining hololive even attending one of Sora's solo live concerts.
	<p>She has adopted the meme "Press F to Pay Respects", and has it as one of her Live Chat emotes.</p>
	<p>She used the n-word during a Grand Theft Auto stream, most likely not knowing the meaning of the word. This is arguably the clip that first skyrocketed hololive's poularity, before Fubuki's "I'm Scatman".</p>
	<p>Almost 2 years later, in her "I'm back GTA" stream, the chat went crazy when this happened, possibly being the most awaited moment of the whole stream, but in the end she didn't use the word.</p>
	<p>Miko has become a fan of the game ARK: Survival Evolved like the rest of her fellow Hololive vtubers, to the point of doing streams playing the game almost all night, every night, and concluding them at dawn after she watches the premiere of Tsunomaki Watame's Watame no Uta. She usually participates in the Tsunomaki janken section of the show and it is a meme the fact that she loses almost all the times against Watame.</p>
	<p>She finally defeated Watame on 4 March 2020, a day before her birthday.</p>
	<p>Miko is not only an avid fan of Watame no Uta but also she is a fan of Kiryu Coco's Asa Coco Live News, to the point of making a version of both shows (and calling her version of Asa Coco Live News, Asa Miko News 朝みこNEWS) during her ARK streams on weekends. Asa Miko News is also called "FAQ News", making an intro mostly based in Coco's one, but saying "FAQ News! F*CK YOU!", instead of saying "Good morning Motherf*ckers!".</p>
	<p>She is the twelveth hololive member to join the official Hololive Subreddit as a moderator.</p>
