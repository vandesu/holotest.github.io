	<p class="additional-desc">【 戌神ころね初配信】！！！！はじめまして！！！！【ホロライブ 新人Vtuber】<br>Korone's introduction.</p>

</div>
<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Korone has a sweet and goofy personality comparable to that of an actual dog. She often kisses other hololive members for no reason, and has a high-pitched laugh that resembles a train whistle or flute.</p>

	<p>Like most dogs, Korone is fiercely loyal, specifically to Nekomata Okayu. The two are rarely seen apart, and the pair is known as "OkaKoro". In fact, the two are so close that Okayu didn't mind Korone grabbing and massaging her breasts during their sleepover after Korone had a exhaustive day of dance practice and concert work, which can be seen in a more maternal light.</p>

	<p>Korone has a fondness for retro games, especially those that are more niche (or even poorly-made). She gets a lot of amusement from the strangeness in these games, often laughing at how absurd they can be.</p>

	<p>While her activities usually look playful and sugary, Korone can also be quite terrifying at times; for example, she accidentally revealed that she had searched for torture/execution methods in her mobile browser history, laughed joyfully while using the chainsaw in Doom, and was completely unfazed by a scene in Heavy Rain where the protagonist (under Korone's control) was forced to cut off his own finger. Many holoGirls, A-chan included, have gone out of their way to say Korone is flat out crazy.</p>

	<p>Young Koronesukis on the other hand took to her actions like she was too innocent to understand the implications of what she is actually doing, when in reality, Korone is a fan of splatterhouse styled horror, referencing movies like Human Centipede and Saw as her preferences, while voicing traditional ghost stories as her least preferred genre, which was further cemented in her 2 playthroughs of "Tsugu no Hi" games with her screaming at literally everything. She has also gone on the record to abuse her fans (represented by Listener-kun), usually seen at the end of her streams where she forgets to give her fans fingers back until they rot or even having comical backdoor tragedies happen like giving back Listener-kun's finger only to swipe her fans money to gamble with in Dragon Quest. Yet in spite of all of her less than savory traits, she's somehow impossible to hate.</p>

	<p>In a more dry and serious light, however, Korone has shared confidence issues during her Roomania 203 playthrough due to measuring her worth to other's actions causing her to criticize herself unneededly. Though her time in hololive seems to be helping in this aspect.</p>

	<p>Korone's greeting her viewers with "Yubi! Yubi!" which originated from her desire to have her own unique greeting. During her first stream with the other members of hololive Gamers Korone noticed that she was the only one out of the group that didn't have her own greeting. She joked about possibly greeting her viewers by asking for their fingers, after which they would reply "Yubi! Yubi!" in return. Her battle cry when playing games is "Orayo!"</p>

<hr>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Mascot and Fans</h2>
	<p>Her fanbase is officially called "Koronesuki" (ころねすきー) and is represented on screen as Listener-kun, sometimes with Hosoinu her dog mascot.</p>
	<p>Japanese fans often donate 563 yen. This is goroawase, or a number-based pun, read as "Koro-san". Although Korone didn't pick up on the pun until April 2021 when she was reading super chats after a Dragon Quest stream.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
<p>Whenever she puts all focus on gameplay, she often makes unintelligible battle cries such as "nya," "rua," and "wryy."</p>
<p>She spent half a month grinding PvP in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate after it was released on 7 December 2018, hoping to get to VIP ranking. She mainly played as Cloud, Joker, and Lucina.</p>
Her favorite animes are Yosuga no Sora and Lovelive!, but she doesn't know the song 届かない恋 from White Album.
The nickname "Sololive" comes from the fact that she tends to play games alone.</p>
<p>She is a fan of the comic artist Tsukudani Norio as well as Inuyama Tamaki, who was designed (and voiced) by her.
She likes reading light novels, but can barely read them because of most of the texts being not annotated with furigana, and instead spends most of her time reading manga (with annotated furigana).</p>
<p>She uses a lot of exclamation marks in her tweets (！！！). This behavior has spread to other virtual YouTubers.</p>
<p>Aqua is known for faking retirements on multiple occasions, singing sad songs and ending her streams with a black screen. During a Minecraft stream on 2 February 2019, she performed another retirement speech during a stream on hololive's Minecraft server, on which she created a model of herself and blew it up with TNTs, which were supposed to be the fireworks celebrating her retirement.</p>
<p>Aqua has been noted by other members of hololive as being particularly slight, short, and petite in terms of stature. During Aqua's Wii Fit stream, in addition to revealing her height to be 4 feet and 10 inches (148 cm), she accidentally revealed her weight to be a mere 95 pounds (43 kg). When Aqua first met Murasaki Shion in-person, Shion (who is already comparatively short) apparently remarked at how "small" Aqua was and condescendingly patted her on the head, much to Aqua's dismay. Aqua's short and light build is something other hololive members frequently lightly tease her over but simultaneously something they cite as a part of what makes her cute. Aqua's height of 4' 10" is coincidentally the typical length of a mop-handle, which has resulted in an ongoing meme in which fan-art depicts her as a mop among her fans, sometimes as a red onion and a tissue box on top of the handle.</p>
<p>She is really close to Kagura Mea, having done a lot of collaborations with Aqua, with their pairing being known as "Meaqua" (稱めあくあ). She has also gone to Mea's house on multiple occasions to do streams, with her going as far as to call her girlfriend on a tweet from 8 March 2019.</p>
<p>She made a group called the hololive Resistance army Iron Aqua Group. She is the leader and creator of the group in Minecraft, with a large underground base full of TNT. According to her, she is ready to rebel at any moment. She showed the place to Matsuri, and Matsuri became a member of hololive Resistence too. Unfortunately for her, Matsuri betrayed her during Tokino Sora's visit. Aqua's morale remained high while Aqua facing Sora until she called her an enemy, which caused her to stop speaking properly.</p>
<p>Her "group" was latter referenced when she appeared on Dawn of the Breakers, on which her unit name is called hololive Resistance.</p>
<p>She likes to say "You are weak; I am strong" (お前、弱い、あてぃし、強い) whenever she faces a boss when playing games like Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. She often gets fixed up even before she can finish the whole sentence.</p>
<p>Aqua established her own company, Akukin Kensetsu, on the hololive Minecraft JP server and recruited Houshou Marine as her first employee (eventually 2nd-in-command), before expanding to recruit Ookami Mio (3rd-in-command) to compete with Usada Kensetsu. Akukin Kensetsu later conducted a series of interviews to recruit more employees. From it, 8 employees were added: Yuzuki Choco, Yukihana Lamy, Momosuzu Nene, Aki Rosenthal, Amane Kanata, Airani Iofifteen, Shiranui Flare and Yozora Mel. The company now counts 11 employees.</p>
<p>In 2021, Aqua was chosen, along with Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII from as a character to be crafted into a bust and placed at the examination site of Kyoto University and have various offerings placed in front of her, as per school tradition. The offerings Aqua received included 1,000 Yen, a bottled water, rice balls and a discounted purple onion.</p>
