	<p class="additional-desc">【 桐生ココ初配信】はじめまして、人間！ホロライブ【ホロライブ4代目会長】<br>Coco's introduction.</p>

</div>
<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Coco is an outspoken, irreverent individual who often employs crude humor, foul speech (using "ass" instead of "butt" or "shit" instead of "crap") and swearing, but she isn't as outright lewd as some members like Matsuri in spite of her dominantly intense femininity when on stage. She also enjoys teasing other members and most segments of her morning news show consists of teasing other hololive members over technical difficulties of failings on stream.</p>

	<p>She often pushes the boundaries of what Vtubers can do on YouTube by using thumbnails of her flipping the bird or her questionable content. Despite that, Coco is probably one of the biggest hearted members of hololive. During a live stream of The Raft with Aqua, Aqua shared her feelings about how difficult the life of a virtual Idol could be and Coco gave some truly kind words of encouragement that nearly brought Aqua to tears.</p>

	<p>She's also playful and fun-loving. She started the hololive "ARK Addiction" because she wanted them all to play the game together (going as far as to buy Roboco her copy of ARK: Aberration when she discovered that she'd purchased ARK: Extinction instead) and usually comes to the aid of the other players when the experience technical problems. This is further showed by the fact that, unlike the Nijisanji ARK server, which is PvP, Coco's is PvE. She proposed the construction of a 'hololive house' for all the hololive streamers to live together and help take care of each other.</p>

	<p>Coco loves the Yakuza video game series and streams it often. Her love for Yakuza goes as far that she is called "Kaichou/ 会長" (chairman), which is a title associated with the yakuza and shared by her favorite character, Kazuma Kiryu.</p>

	<p>She sometimes opens her streams in two separate languages, sometimes interchangeably. Reflecting her Asacoco theme, she opens with "Goooood MORNING MOTHERF@$#ERS!" for English viewers, followed by "OKITE, OKITE! OKITE KU-DA-SA-I!" (Wake up, Wake up! WAKE UP PL-EA-SE!) in Japanese.</p>

	<h2 class="profile-headers">Discography</h2>
	<p><a href="../Songs/Tokino_Sora_Songs.html">See here.</a></p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Events</h2>
	<p>She debuted as a DJ at Re:Animation 13 on 12 January 2019.</p>
	<p>On 4 April 2019, she made an appearance in hololive's collaboration with Dawn of the Breakers, she was the central character, and the first ever hololive VTuber to appear in the game. Despite appearing alongside Shirakami Fubuki, Oozora Subaru, Minato Aqua and Yuzuki Choco the first two events were called "The Roboco san x Dawn of the Breakers Crossover".</p>
	<p>On 28 January 2020, it was announced on Dengekionline that she would make an appearance in the game Neptunia Virtual Stars as one of the VTuber guest characters alongside Tokino Sora, Shirakami Fubuki, Sakura Miko, Minato Aqua, Yuzuki Choco, Inugami Korone, Shirogane Noel and Houshou Marine.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Mascot and Fans</h2>
	<p>Her pet is a minotaurlike creature called "Hatotaurus" originally designed by Fubuki. It has the head of a pigeon, goatlike horns, the body of a minotaur and the legs and tail of a wolf.</p>
	<p>Her fanbase name is officially called "Mio-fa", short for Mio's family. ミオファ（みおーんファミリー）.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
	<p>Considerably multi-talented as she is capable of drawing (her original image was drawn by herself), edit videos, sing, cook and is also a skilled gamer.</p>
	<p>Suisei lives with her older sister, who is referred to by fans as "Anemachi". Anemachi is extremely attached to Suisei and appears to be dependent on her for her cooking skills.</p>
	<p>She is notably good at playing competitive Tetris.</p>
	<p>The hashtag #星街すいせい3D (#HoshimachiSuisei3D) became a trending topic worldwide on Twitter when she debuted her 3D model on YouTube.</p>
	<p>Her birthday and her debut date are the same.</p>
	<p>A few years before considering being a VTuber, Suisei participated in several auditions for real-life idol agencies, but was rejected due to the "Jack of all trades, Master of none" trait, according to her. This led to her becoming a Virtual Idol, as a way of not giving up on her dream. However, she was already tired of trying by the beginning of 2019 as an indie Virtual Idol (since she worked in an izakaya [japanese pub], and also had to do the editing of her own videos and other VTubers). Suisei almost gave up, but decided to make one last try. She went to COVER Corp to audition for hololive, but was also rejected, apparently for the same reason as the real-life agencies, since COVER Corp considered that she had many skills (speaking, singing, dancing, drawing and gaming) that could let to failing trying to do everything due to an overload of work. She claims that after receiving rejection e-mail, she e-mailed back seeking for a second chance and is open for suggestion. As a result, hololive replied back to have a second talk; then they told her that she could join, but on the condition of joining INoNaKa Music and focus on music. After more difficulty in INoNaKa Music mostly due to company policy that nearly broke Suisei's heart, she was finally transferred to hololive officially. </p>
	<p>On 11 January 2021, Suisei won the 2nd hololive Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Tournament, with 43 points.</p>
	<p>Suisei's surname, while officially written in English as "Hoshimachi", is often alternatively romanized as "Hoshimati" or "Hosimati" in her videos and account names.</p>
	<p>Suisei popularized the phrase "Hi, honey!" during a Duolingo English learning stream. Although Akai Haato was technically the first to use it, Suisei's endearing delivery of the line, coupled with her recent voice change, has since caused many other members of hololive to repeat it in a similar fashion.</p>
