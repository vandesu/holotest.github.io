<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Tokino Sora is an easy-going, happy and comforting person whose personality has led many fans to call her “Tokino Sora Mama” (ときのそらママ) because of her motherly attitude. Born in Tokyo, she is the member in hololive who most closely fits the image of a "proper" idol, since most of the other members have become infamous for causing mayhem and goofing off. But in spite of the other idols grinding the stereotypical image of an idol to dust and beyond, many in hololive respect Sora and the genuineness of her personality to the point of seeing her as seiso or holy, to which she prefers to be seen as just an ordinary idol.</p>

	<p>Unlike many other idol groups in the industry, and like many others in hololive, nothing about Sora's personality is faking purity. In fact, even in rare less-than-pure instances, such as losing her temper, she is often toothless and harmless if a bit stern. But generally, Sora's mindset in many ways resembles that of a well behaved, innocent child.</p>

	<p>Sora loves horror games and she does not get scared by them. She also loves Rhythm games and live streaming for her fans. She is not very good at rote learning and Oogiri (a game consisted of giving funny answers to several themes). Additionally, she gets easily lost when someone mentions English wordplay jokes and slang terms in her chat and sometimes is teased with the name "Soda-chan" due to her fondness of sweets and because her design looks like a can of Pepsi, leading to the playful, comically cute responds of "<i>Soda-chan Janai!</i>" or "<i>No Soda, No Soda!</i>".</p>

	<p>But when it comes to anything to do with rhythm and sound, Sora's passion for the art drives her to be quite the perfectionist. For example, in hololive's promotional campaign with medicinal candy brand e-ma, Sora would dance to the brand's theme song with better precision, allure, bounce and expressiveness than either Suisei and Aqua. In other instances, she perfectly sings a majority of the covers she does in her 【I tried to sing】series, some of which that are difficult for a normal person to sing as the vocals are mostly done in VOCALOID. She has published several covers, including collaborations with fellow VTubers and even the release of a debut album with a major record label.</p>

	<p>True to her pure hearted nature, Sora dreams of holding a concert at Yokohama Arena, the city where her mother was born.</p>

	<h2 class="profile-headers">A-Chan and Ankimo</h2>
	<p>Sora is aided on her videos by her two friends A-chan and Ankimo.</p>

			<td><p>Yuujin A (友人A, Friend A) better known as A-chan (えーちゃん) is the person in charge of the technical aspects of Sora's live streams. She was originally spoken about or featured in a few videos but only illustrated as a roughly-drawn woman's face with glasses and a hair tie. In July 2018 she received a full design, and in November 2018 A-chan started her own Twitter account. On 7 September 2020 she got a new 3D model, the same date as Sora's third anniversary debut.</p></td>
