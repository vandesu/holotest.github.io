	<p>Other hololive members, like Sora, have expressed their admiration for Flare because of her versatile voice and mature aura. However, although Flare is known to be cool and aloof at first glance, she is actually quite childish and girly, which comes out the most in her horror streams and when she is drunk.</p>

	<p>She greets her fans with "Konnakiri!"</p>
