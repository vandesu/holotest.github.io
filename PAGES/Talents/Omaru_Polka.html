	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Polka is known for her silliness and spunk. As a natural-born joker, the only thing to be expected during her streams is unpredictability. True to her nature as a circus performer, she is very energetic and outgoing. As seen on various of her streams and 3D performances, she has a distinctive laugh that can be compared to Pekora's. She also has an array of various instruments at her disposal (which include but are not limited to: bells, rotary phone, glockenspiel, vibraslap, and rubber chickens).</p>

	<p>Despite these traits, she is often at the receiving end of pranks and teasing from fellow hololive members and her chat.</p>

	<p>She prefers her audience to shout "Poruka Oruka?" (Where's Polka) on her loading screens so she may greet her audience with "Poruka oru yo!" (Polka's here!).</p>
