</div>
<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Fubuki is usually always cheerful and excited, singing little songs and making many in-jokes. She is shy when confronted with new circumstances, and when embarrassed she "hides" at the bottom of the screen with only her fox ears peeking up. She becomes enthralled in games and has cute conversations with scripted game characters, or voice acts as characters while making effects.</p>

	<p>However, she has a cunning, ruthless and twisted side to her, shown most often when playing "Project Winter" with other VTubers. She has described herself as a 'hunter' and has displayed both extreme skill, to the point of nearly winning a 1 v 4 battle all on her own, as well as a methodical thought process. For example, during a "Project Winter" stream, Fubuki collaborated with fellow in-game traitors to purposely line up her shots at a wolf with Matsuri in an attempt to kill her early and make it look like an accident. And when playing Undertale, she started the G-route first and was rather sarcastic/apathetic towards Flowey begging for his life, something most players usually feel bad about the G-route. She also stole "Human" meat in Minecraft and crafted them into "Friend" meat with a wide smile on her face.</p>

	<p>Fubuki is one to fearlessly march to the beat of her own drum, sometimes to a career risking degree. For example, she has once said that if hololive forced her to say something she didn't want to on stream, she would rather quit her job. And in another instance, she decided to call Roberu on his stream without care, which is a huge risk to any idol, real or virtual, due to followers potentially attacking her for "tainting her purity" by talking to a boy (among other "noble fan" nonsense).</p>

	<p>She greets her viewers with "Kon Kon Kitsune!"</p>

	<h2 class="profile-headers">History</h2>
	<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Her Twitter account was opened on 19 May 2018 while her YouTube channel was created on 23 May. although she did not start her activity on YouTube until a live-stream on 1 June.</p>

2018
<p>On 17 October, she debuted her first 3D model becoming the fourth hololive member to do so after Tokino Sora, Roboco, and Sakura Miko.</p>

2019
<p>On 22 March, she did a live-stream where she debuted her second 3D model. In the same stream, she also announced that other members of hololive will also be getting their own and that there would be two new members of hololive Gamers starting from April. Her first stream after the debut to feature her new 3D model was broadcast two days later on the 24th.</p>
</p>
<p>On 28 August, she debuted her 3D swimsuit outfit.

<p>On 19 December, hololive's Twitter account published that both Fubuki and Mio would get new 2D costumes. She unveiled hers in a stream on 22 December, with Mio also appearing in her new costume.</p>

2020
<p>On 1 January, she announced on her Twitter account the reveal of her third 2D costume, a kimono, to celebrate the new year. This was revealed later that day on a stream.</p>

<p>On 24 January, along with the other hololive girls up to the third generation, she debuted her 3D idol outfit at hololive's 1st fest Nonstop Story. Similar to the other members, the costume featured a gold-trimmed white dress but with her signature light-blue color on her bow-tie and dress peplum. On her head sits a small crown to the left of her ahoge.</p>

<p>On 15 July, she reached 700,000 subscribers, being the first hololive member to do so, surpassing Siro. Nine days later on 24 July, she also surpassed Mirai Akari, becoming the third most subscribed VTuber on YouTube (fourth if counting A.I. Games). These milestones are relevant as both of them had held those positions for nearly the entire time since their debuts in the second half of 2017.</p>

<p>On 28 July, she announced on her Twitter account that her original 2D model would be updated to the 2.0 version. She debuted her updated model during a stream later the same day, featuring more facial expressions, movement added to her fox ears and her ahoge and general movement improvements, more in line with the model capabilities of the other members of hololive GAMERS onwards. She also announced on this day that she would get a new costume.</p>

<p>On 1 August, in celebration of getting one million subscribers on her bilibili channel, she debuted her fouth 2D costume in a stream on YouTube, with all the improvements made to her 2D model, the new outfit features a big white jacket with blue and orange motifs. Identification tags bearing the hololive and GAMERS logos line her jacket and blouse, which are reminiscent of her original outfit but given a modern/techwear redo. She also received a new hair pin, a choker, and two new hairstyles: one with hair fully loose and one with twintails. Fubuki has described this costume as having a cyberpunk style with her fans joking that it came out of Arknights, a popular mobile game she plays.</p>

<p>On 5 October, as part of her birthday celebration Fubuki debuted her fifth 2D costume, a blue dress with a bow with a small golden fox badge, a small blue hat and a dark blue suit. Near the end of the stream, she also announced that she would get a Nendoroid figure.</p>

<p>On 5 November, Fubuki became the third hololive member to reach 1 million subscribers on YouTube and the second member of the Japanese branch to do so. She is also the first member of hololive JP's 1st Gen, as well as the second member of hololive GAMERS, to reach it.</p>

	<h2 class="profile-headers">Fans</h2>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
<h3>Identity</h3>
<p>Fubuki is a fox-girl; specifically an arctic fox. Prior to joining hololive, she lived as a mountain fox, and spent a lot of time sleeping. Japanese foxes are capable of assuming alternate forms, and Fubuki took hololive as an opportunity to spend time living as a human.</p>
<p>A running joke is that Fubuki is constantly mistaken for a cat.</p>
<p>"Fubuki" is Japanese for "blizzard". She writes it in katakana.</p>
<p>Shirakami is a Japanese surname written with the kanji 「白上」, which individually mean "white" and "above". Written with different kanji, shirakami can also mean "white hair" or "blank paper".</p>
<p>Fubuki is currently the only hololive member to considered be part of multiple generations. She debuted as part of hololive 1st generation, but was also listed as part of hololive Gamers. In hololive's Fukkireta Chorus video Fubuki uniquely appears twice, both with the members of hololive's 1st generation and with the members of hololive Gamers.</p>
<p>Fubuki has a dark side companion, Kurokami-san. Kurokami got a 3D model on the 2019 Birthday celebration.</p>
<p>The key on her waist is to her grandfather's treasure chest. She received the key long ago, but doesn't know where the treasure chest is.</p>
<h3>In-jokes and nicknames</h3>
<p>The nickname "Scatman" comes from a video titled Im. Scatman, uploaded on 24 October 2019, which features her attempt to sings an a capella cover of Scatman John's 1994 pop hit Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop). It was her most viewed video until her original song Say! Fanfare, and received numerous fan remixes, including Fubuki's own 3D remake.</p>
<p>The nickname "hamburger" came from her use of the hamburger outfit in Fall Guys. Her nickname in that game is, Fox Burger King, which spells FBK, an abbreviation for Fubuki. Since then, she is usually depicted on her streams loading screens as a pixel sprite carefreely eating a burger while wearing a crown.</p>
<p>The English-speaking audience sometimes refer to Fubuki as Friend, and her fans as Friends. This relates to a video where an English-speaking user asked Fubuki to be their wife, to which she responded by saying she would instead be their friend.</p>
<p>Corn sometimes appears in Fubuki's content. This a pun on "kon", the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound made by a fox.</p>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>Fubuki pays close attention to her kouhai's streams. She often watches hololive streams as a way to relax.</p>
<p>Fubuki is a workaholic, and almost never takes breaks. In 2020, she took a one-week holiday at management's insistence, her first holiday since her debut.</p>
<p>She is not good with the English language. Her introductory video had the English version of her name misspelled as "Fhunbuki".</p>
<p>Just like her fellow hololive VTuber Hoshimachi Suisei, Fubuki has shown a fond liking towards young boys. This has culminated in her writing multiple poems about watching Shotas in the rain, watching Shotas at the pool, and watching Shotas at the ice cream shop, all on Ookami Mio's competitive Haiku stream, much to Suisei's chagrin.</p>
<p>She is the fourteenth hololive member to join the official Hololive Subreddit as a moderator.</p>
<p>Fubuki introduced many non-Japanese viewers to hololive, including Takanashi Kiara. Kiara once sang Fubuki's song on stream, Fubuki promised to return the favor by performing Kiara's song once she reaches 1 million subscribers.</p>
<p>She shares the same designer with Shirahari Uni and Lee Siu from Nijisanji KR.</p>
