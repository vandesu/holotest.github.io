	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Miko is a self-proclaimed "elite" gamer who is somewhat melodramatic and tends to become emotionally attached to NPCs and inanimate objects. Fans tend to use the term "elite" ironically to highlight Miko's questionable decision-making skills, as well as her tendency to speak garbled nonsense punctuated by the occasional F-bomb. Though Miko specializes in role-playing games, much of the humor on her channel stems from the fact that even while playing graphic and violent games like Grand Theft Auto, she rarely takes her role seriously. Her love for erotic games often finds its way into other games that she plays, especially those featuring freely adjustable camera angles and skirt-wearing female characters.</p>

	<p>She greets her viewers with "Nyahello".</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Appearance</h2>
	<p>Prior to her debut, her appearance is akin to a Shrine Maiden (not traditional-like) with a short pink-hair with an ahoge and a cherry blossom hair ornament in her left as well as pink thigh-highs.</p>
	
	<p>In her new outfit, she wears a much more traditional Shrine Maiden outfit along with long detached sleeves, and her stockings are asymmetrical and white instead of pink. The cherry blossom hair ornament is replaced with a bell ribbon, and her hair is longer.</p>
<hr>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Mascot and Fans</h2>
	<p>She has a talking pink cat by the name of "Kintoki" (金時) as her pet shikigami.</p>
	<p>She officially calls her fans "35P" (みこぴー Mikopi) who also serve as mascots in her channel. They are usually depicted as white cats in her videos. Her name "Miko" (みこ) can be harmonized into the numbers "3" and "5" in Japanese, which also corresponds to her birthday (5 March), hence the origin of the fan name. Fans often Super Chat her streams in amounts of "3,535" as a reference to her name.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
	<p>The character designer for her original design is Tanaka Yuuichi, who is known as the character designer for A Certain Magical Index and My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU TOO!, among others. Her hairstyle bears some similarity to the main characters of both shows, Misaka Mikoto and Hikigaya Hachiman respectively.</p>
	<p>During a collaboration stream with Suou Patra of HoneyStrap, Miko confirms that her "NyaHello" greeting is a reference to Yuigahama Yui from Oregairu, who is also designed by Tanaka Yuuichi. In the series, Yui greets characters with "Yahallo".</p>
	<p>Miko also sang a cover of the song Yukitoki, which was the opening song in the first season of the anime.</p>
	<p>She has varying official height measurements.</p>
	<p>On 5 March 2019, she agreed with an artist that deduced her height to be about 156 to 157 cm.</p>
	<p>On 28 March 2019, she tweeted an image stating her height to be at 153 cm.</p>
	<p>During the Arte Akihabara and hololive collaboration campaign, an official height chart of hololive virtual YouTubers was put on display with her height being stated as 152 cm. Her official website also lists her as this height.</p>
	<p>She started to work as a VTuber to fulfill her dreams of becoming an idol.</p>
	<p>She likes playing Eroge and has a playlist of her Eroge streams in her channel.</p>
	<p>She has, in many occasions, accidentally opened an Eroge in the middle of playing another game in her stream.</p>
	<p>She once told during one of her streams that Saga Planets is her favorite Eroge Studio. Among the games from this studio she has played and streamed are Hatsuyuki Sakura, Kin'iro Loveriche, and Natsuyume Nagisa.</p>
	<p>She collaborated on a stream with Maimoto Keisuke of Nijisanji about Eroge Opening music.</p>
	<p>One of her most "eroge lover" moments, was during a Minecraft stream (privated, with avaiable translate), when she asked to be insulted, to try to annoy her. The first two people didn't do anything to her, but just a few seconds later, one guy said "Eroges are boring", and she went totally annoyed.</p>
	<p>Miko is well known for her frequent interactions and friendship with Usada Pekora on and off screens, forming the pair “PekoMiko”. As the pair is famous hololive released the song “PekoMiko Daisensō” as one of the song for collaboration with the rhythm game WACCA themed after the duo’s interactions and their unofficial collabs that are known as “wars”.
	<p>Miko has proclaimed to be Tokino Sora biggest fan, she was already a fan before joining hololive even attending one of Sora's solo live concerts.
	<p>She has adopted the meme "Press F to Pay Respects", and has it as one of her Live Chat emotes.</p>
	<p>She used the n-word during a Grand Theft Auto stream, most likely not knowing the meaning of the word. This is arguably the clip that first skyrocketed hololive's poularity, before Fubuki's "I'm Scatman".</p>
	<p>Almost 2 years later, in her "I'm back GTA" stream, the chat went crazy when this happened, possibly being the most awaited moment of the whole stream, but in the end she didn't use the word.</p>
	<p>Miko has become a fan of the game ARK: Survival Evolved like the rest of her fellow Hololive vtubers, to the point of doing streams playing the game almost all night, every night, and concluding them at dawn after she watches the premiere of Tsunomaki Watame's Watame no Uta. She usually participates in the Tsunomaki janken section of the show and it is a meme the fact that she loses almost all the times against Watame.</p>
	<p>She finally defeated Watame on 4 March 2020, a day before her birthday.</p>
	<p>Miko is not only an avid fan of Watame no Uta but also she is a fan of Kiryu Coco's Asa Coco Live News, to the point of making a version of both shows (and calling her version of Asa Coco Live News, Asa Miko News 朝みこNEWS) during her ARK streams on weekends. Asa Miko News is also called "FAQ News", making an intro mostly based in Coco's one, but saying "FAQ News! F*CK YOU!", instead of saying "Good morning Motherf*ckers!".</p>
	<p>She is the twelveth hololive member to join the official Hololive Subreddit as a moderator.</p>
