</div>
<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Aqua is a bumbling airhead who somehow manages to become the victim of every joke in which she gets involved. She is also childish and prone to throwing tantrums, smashing her keyboard, and hyperventilating when things don't go as planned (which is most of the time). She enjoys playing pranks and causing mischief, but it almost always backfires because of a combination of poor planning and bad luck. To make matters worse, Aqua makes no attempt to avoid embarrassing situations to the point at which many wonder if she might actually be masochistic. She has asked other hololive members, including Uruha Rushia, to bully her on several occasions.</p>

	<p>However, while Aqua appears to be an incompetent crybaby, she is deceptively skilled at highly technical video games like Sekiro, Dark Souls, Apex Legends (Diamond rank),and League of Legends (Diamond rank). She is also a prolific streamer, with a record of five streams in a single day.</p>

	<p>According to other hololive members, Aqua is kind and responsible but extremely introverted while off-camera, only opening up while streaming.</p>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Appearance</h2>
	<p>She is a virtual maid who wears a marine-themed maid uniform and a white mob cap decorated with an anchor though it has also been described as a "tissue box." Despite her name and appearance, she has nothing to do with water. She has purple hair (resembling a red onion), with twin spiral ponytails decorated with navy-blue ribbons. She also has a few streaks of light-blue hair in her bangs and the inner edge of her ponytails and a light blue ahoge.</p>

	<p>On 26 September, Aqua debuted with a new 2D Live costume. She now wears two large braids, with the two small braids on each side of her bangs from her original design, decorated with a light navy blue headband. Her white top resembles a sailor fuku, with a pastel navy blue ribbon bow, and a row of little buttons going down the center. She wears a high-waisted corset pleat skirt that extends to directly beneath her bust, styled with two thinner ribbon bows. She now wears plain white leggings and black loafers instead of leaving her legs bare and wearing kitten heels. Aqua‘s new costume comes with a removable white coat, a gray stuffed cat which she can carry or attach to her headband, detachable cat ears and a tail, and pink-tinted heart sunglasses. She also has the option to wear this outfit with her old head model.</p>

<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Fans</h2>
	<p>Her fanbase is officially called Aqua Crew (あくあクルー).</p>
	<p>Inversely, fans in the west sometimes refer to her as "Baqua" (ばくあ), a pun on Baka (ばか, lit. "stupid") and Aqua. This is usually used in moments where she thinks or does something unapologetically moronic that, of course, will backfire on her, especially in her idea department.</p>
<hr>
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Trivia</h2>
<p>Whenever she puts all focus on gameplay, she often makes unintelligible battle cries such as "nya," "rua," and "wryy."</p>
<p>She spent half a month grinding PvP in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate after it was released on 7 December 2018, hoping to get to VIP ranking. She mainly played as Cloud, Joker, and Lucina.</p>
Her favorite animes are Yosuga no Sora and Lovelive!, but she doesn't know the song 届かない恋 from White Album.
The nickname "Sololive" comes from the fact that she tends to play games alone.</p>
<p>She is a fan of the comic artist Tsukudani Norio as well as Inuyama Tamaki, who was designed (and voiced) by her.
She likes reading light novels, but can barely read them because of most of the texts being not annotated with furigana, and instead spends most of her time reading manga (with annotated furigana).</p>
<p>She uses a lot of exclamation marks in her tweets (！！！). This behavior has spread to other virtual YouTubers.</p>
<p>Aqua is known for faking retirements on multiple occasions, singing sad songs and ending her streams with a black screen. During a Minecraft stream on 2 February 2019, she performed another retirement speech during a stream on hololive's Minecraft server, on which she created a model of herself and blew it up with TNTs, which were supposed to be the fireworks celebrating her retirement.</p>
<p>Aqua has been noted by other members of hololive as being particularly slight, short, and petite in terms of stature. During Aqua's Wii Fit stream, in addition to revealing her height to be 4 feet and 10 inches (148 cm), she accidentally revealed her weight to be a mere 95 pounds (43 kg). When Aqua first met Murasaki Shion in-person, Shion (who is already comparatively short) apparently remarked at how "small" Aqua was and condescendingly patted her on the head, much to Aqua's dismay. Aqua's short and light build is something other hololive members frequently lightly tease her over but simultaneously something they cite as a part of what makes her cute. Aqua's height of 4' 10" is coincidentally the typical length of a mop-handle, which has resulted in an ongoing meme in which fan-art depicts her as a mop among her fans, sometimes as a red onion and a tissue box on top of the handle.</p>
<p>She is really close to Kagura Mea, having done a lot of collaborations with Aqua, with their pairing being known as "Meaqua" (稱めあくあ). She has also gone to Mea's house on multiple occasions to do streams, with her going as far as to call her girlfriend on a tweet from 8 March 2019.</p>
<p>She made a group called the hololive Resistance army Iron Aqua Group. She is the leader and creator of the group in Minecraft, with a large underground base full of TNT. According to her, she is ready to rebel at any moment. She showed the place to Matsuri, and Matsuri became a member of hololive Resistence too. Unfortunately for her, Matsuri betrayed her during Tokino Sora's visit. Aqua's morale remained high while Aqua facing Sora until she called her an enemy, which caused her to stop speaking properly.</p>
<p>Her "group" was latter referenced when she appeared on Dawn of the Breakers, on which her unit name is called hololive Resistance.</p>
<p>She likes to say "You are weak; I am strong" (お前、弱い、あてぃし、強い) whenever she faces a boss when playing games like Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. She often gets fixed up even before she can finish the whole sentence.</p>
<p>Aqua established her own company, Akukin Kensetsu, on the hololive Minecraft JP server and recruited Houshou Marine as her first employee (eventually 2nd-in-command), before expanding to recruit Ookami Mio (3rd-in-command) to compete with Usada Kensetsu. Akukin Kensetsu later conducted a series of interviews to recruit more employees. From it, 8 employees were added: Yuzuki Choco, Yukihana Lamy, Momosuzu Nene, Aki Rosenthal, Amane Kanata, Airani Iofifteen, Shiranui Flare and Yozora Mel. The company now counts 11 employees.</p>
<p>In 2021, Aqua was chosen, along with Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII from as a character to be crafted into a bust and placed at the examination site of Kyoto University and have various offerings placed in front of her, as per school tradition. The offerings Aqua received included 1,000 Yen, a bottled water, rice balls and a discounted purple onion.</p>
