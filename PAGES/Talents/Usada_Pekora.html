	<p class="additional-desc">【 兎田ぺこら初配信】はじめまして、兎田ぺこらです！！【ホロライブ 新人Vtuber】<br>Pekora's introduction.</p>

</div>
<hr>	
<div class="profile-desc">
	
	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Pekora hails from the nation of Pekoland, where she claims she is a member of royalty. While not much is currently known about Pekoland, it is assumed that its denizens are, like Pekora, Animals humans with rabbit-ears and comparatively long lifespans, and that the rabbit-motif apparent in Pekora's fashion and accessories is significant to their culture. According to Pekora, "peko" is the only word in the Pekolandish language. In-line with her claims of a royal upbringing, Pekora's personality can be described as outwardly bratty, haughty, immature and surly, but genuinely playful and friendly. But when not on camera she has been noted by other hololive girls as polite and shy to as she doesn't like people in her space, as well as one to internalize her pain (as noted by Hoshou Marine) which ended up prematurely ending one of her streams with her in tears.</p>

	<p>Pekora is infamous for mischief, to the point where other hololive members will instantly become suspicious of any project if they learn that Pekora was involved. While her intended victim is usually Sakura Miko, no one is exempt from her trolling, not even herself. Pekora's fans appropriately display this same kind of attitude and are known to ruthlessly tease her through the chat when the opportunity arises. In spite of everything, Pekora still wants to be recognized as a real idol, but to her chagrin, fans mostly think of her as a "comedian" and "crazy rabbit", not helped by her constant sprees of often self-inflicted misfortune. Even when she is in a idol-like scenario, something always backfires on her. Fittingly, she is also particularly well-known for being able to almost instantly flip between smugly gloating and desperately begging for help/forgiveness depending on whether or not she has the upper hand in a situation.</p>

	<p>Pekora has a distinctive laugh (frequently represented in text as "AH↓ HA↑ HA↑ HA↑") somewhat resembling that of an older female aristocrat, and frequently interjects her sentences with the "-peko" suffix, though she has been known to forget this occasionally. She asserts her dominance by shouting "PE↗ KO↘ PE↗ KO↘ PE↗ KO↘"</p>
