	<h2 class="profile-headers">Personality</h2>
	<p>Nene is a cheerful girl who loves to talk and sing. She dreams of becoming an idol and having her own anime opening song. She's very clumsy in games but shown impressive luck, displaying good aiming skills in Apex despite being a beginner or having 100% win rate in the first Among Us collaboration stream. She's overconfident about her gaming skills, calling herself Supernenechi. She is also complete beginner at Minecraft, falling a total of 16 times in her first hololive server Minecraft stream and failing Roboco's magma test. She was also seen as brute who indiscriminately attacked NPCs, animals and objects in the first 5th gen Craftopia stream in which Lamy scolded her for it.„ÄÄ</p>

	<p>She also flirts with other members of hololive using her handsome voice („Ç§„Ç±„Éú), calling members such as Lamy as "my Lamy" (‰ø∫„ÅÆ„É©„Éü„Ç£) or sending virtual kiss sound („Å°„ÇÖ) to girls. She admitted that she has many wives which include Lamy, Suisei, Ina, and Kiara.</p>

	<p>She also revealed that she applied for hololive four times. She did not get an immediate reply from first three applications so she kept submitting an application until they called her. Polka and Lamy thought that Nene is the toughest 5th gen member and easily bounces back to being optimistic.</p>

	<p>She often streams during lunch time (12:00 JST) chatting with fans while eating or drawing pictures. She displayed decent drawing skills and had collaborated with Marine and her designer, Nishizawa 5mm, for a drawing stream. She has shown closeness with her fellow 5th gen member, Polka, both playing Mario Kart and Clubhouse 51.</p>

	<p>She often adds -aru at the end of her sentences similar to Kagura of Gin Tama. However, she stopped using it lately (October 2020) because she is not confident about it.</p>
